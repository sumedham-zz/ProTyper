* 4:00-8:00 PM November 22, 2015 (4 HOURS)o Added Imageso Added functionality to images so that they display which finger displays what keyo Added accuracy featureo Attempted to incorporate sound using import os --> Failed
* 12:30-1:30 PM November 24, 2015 (1 HOUR)o Worked on creating updates for typing mistakes
o Attempted to install and use pyttsx (text to speech)
o Researched simple ML 
* 1:00 - 7:00PM November 26, 2015 (6 HOURS)
o Found out pyttsx will not work simultaneously with Tkinter
o Spent time trying to use multithreading to implement pyttsxwith tkinter
o Implemented an alternative through os

* 8:00PM -12:00AM November 27th, 2015 (4 HOURS)
o Created ways for user’s errors to be logged so program could use them to test the User on weak spots.
